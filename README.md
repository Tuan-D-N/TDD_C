# A C++ Versition of TDD

## Overview
Decision diagrams have been used in the simulation and equivalence checking of quantum circuits. Inspired by the efficiency and flexibility of Tensor Networks. A tensor network-based decision diagram has been proposed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02618. This repository gives a C++ implementation of the Tensor Decision Diagram(TDD), and the package is developed based on the DD package https://github.com/cda-tum/dd_package/tree/non-oop.
